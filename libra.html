        <p>Librans are born between September 23 and October 22, and belong to the Air element of the zodiac (along with Gemini and Aquarius). Air signs are cool, calculating, cerebral and charming. They possess a natural surface cleverness and a swift humour that make them all fantastic company. Libra is the most charming of the group.

            Librans are best known for their love of balance. Not in the way of somersaulting on a beam or walking a tightrope, but in keeping everything in their realm on a fair, harmonious and even keel. They cannot stand chaos, mess or dickery. They are idealistic perfectionists, and they invest most of their energy in keeping their environment and lives lovely, tidy and orderly. An astrological Marie Kondo!
            
            However, Libra is also ruled by Venus, a planet which holds sway over beauty, the arts, love and pleasure. This makes them wonderful lovers, extremely aesthetic and into beautiful things, and certainly born with a taste for ALL of the finer things in life. Librans are big on self-indulgence, and this is where their Marie Kondo’ing attitude can do a bit skew-whiff as they let themselves off the hook and go party (oh well, it’s 5 o’clock somewhere, right?)
            
            To get an idea of the classic Libran personality traits and types, we need only to look to some of the most famous autumn babies: Kim Kardashian, Bella Thorne, Cardi B, Gwen Stefani and Halsey.</p>
            
            <h2>Who are you most compatible with?</h2>
                
                <p> Libra and Taurus are both ruled by Venus so they share a liking for beauty, the arts, self-indulgence and pleasure. Srsly, get these two together and they could shop, eat, drink and bonk their way through 24:7. Champion Indulgers, a dangerous combo!

                    The Air sign posse also naturally click with each other, and love to chat, debate and discuss anything and everything - so Gemini, Aquarius and Libra make for wonderful companions. Libra is probably the most earthily passionate of the trio, but can still provoke great chemistry with the other two.</p>
