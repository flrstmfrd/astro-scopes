        <p>Scorpios are born between October 23rd and November 21st, and belong to the Water element of the zodiac (along with Cancer and Pisces). It’s a funny thing because many people assume that Scorpios are one of the Fire signs (just like people often think Aquarius is a Water sign- WRONG), given their obvious passion and strength. Scorpios LOOK like a Fire sign at first glance but, underneath, it’s all a LOT more emotional and layered. Scorpios got ‘levels’, they are the zodiac’s enigma.

            Emotional, imaginative and intense, Scorpio is like the big, bad elder sister of the Water sign crew. You don’t mess with the turbulent, deadly scorpion my friend, their sting can be fatal - and they make the other signs of the zodiac (apart from maybe Aries, who they share a planetary influence with) look like wusses!
            
            They are ruled by two planetary influences (and only Pisces and Aquarius can say the same)- Pluto (god of the Underworld) and Mars (god of War)… and that kinda’ sums them up. Dark and dangerous. Drawn to what lies beneath, to the mysteries of life, to the ‘underbelly’ of humanity, and also able to fight to the death if they feel wronged / betrayed / abused. You HAVE been warned.
            
            To get an idea of the classic Scorpio personality traits and types, we need only to look to some of the most famous Halloween children: Drake, Kendall Jenner, Winona Ryder, and Ciara.
            
            These guys can brood.</p>
           
                <h2>Who are you most compatible with?</h2>
                <p> Aries and Scorpio share a planetary influence, but it’s Mars so unless they’re on the same side (in which case they’re unstoppable) this CAN go another way... like, downhill. They’re either the fiercest of allies or the deadliest of enemies.

                    The Water sign trio understand each others' moods and emotional intensity, they get that they’re a bit deeper than your Average Joe, and they usually form incredibly close bonds - Scorpio, Cancer and Pisces.
