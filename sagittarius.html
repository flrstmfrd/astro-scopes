        <p>Sagittarians are born between November 22 and December 21, and belong to the Fire element of the zodiac (along with Leo and Aries). This lot are all big characters, and live life to the max. If star signs were theme park rides, the Fire sign crew would be the hair-raising, white-knuckle rollercoaster.

            Sagittarians are optimistic, restless, progressive and adventurous. They can’t stand to be contained, thwarted or bossed about, and freedom is their catnip. Woe betide a boss/ partner/parent/friend who tries to tell their Saggie comrade what to do… expect to hear the door slam as they bolt for the hills!
            
            They are ruled by Jupiter, which makes them all jammy so-and-sos, who (no matter how absurd an escapade they pursue) will land in clover, on their feet, smelling of roses. Sagittarians are great companions for wild weekends, especially in Vegas, where some of their infamous luck may rub off on you!
            
            Their symbol is the archer, which suits their outdoorsy, restless nature. They adore ‘hunting’ (love interests and bargains vs actual animals, as they love all creatures great and small), they enjoy the thrill of the chase.
            
            </p>
           
                <h2>Who are you most compatible with?</h2>
                <p> At face value? EVERYONE. Sagittarius is one of the most open, friendly, enthusiastic and energetic signs - a human Tigger. Getting to REALLY know them is a trickier business, but that comes later.

                    The Fire sign trio are a close-knit bunch, forging friendships and FIRE relationships amongst themselves. They share a need for adventure, passion and competition which other signs often find daunting/irritating/intense. So, Sagittarius, Leo and Aries are all good matches with each other.</p>
