        <p>Pisces are born between February 20th and March 20th, and belong to the Water element of the zodiac (along with Cancer and Scorpio). The Water sign brigade are ALL about feelings- they catch them a lot.

            Be careful though, because this element contains two of the most *dangerous* star signs... Pisces isn't one of them though (hello Cancer! hi there Scorpio!) so we're OK. Pisces though is a total melt.
            
            The zodiac's fish is ruled by the planet Neptune, named after the Roman god of the sea and all watery depths, and is like the magician of the solar system - representing illusion, imagination, creativity and bewitchment. Neptune holds sway over a mixed bag of human activity e.g. drama, dance, poetry, addiction, hypnosis, institutions and poison. Crumbs, Pisces, you've got a LOT of hobbyist options there...</p>
           
                <h2>Who are you most compatible with?</h2>

                <p> The Water sign trio (Pisces, Scorpio and Cancer) all get on well with each other. They're all emotional, secretive and intuitive. There's a lot of watching vs talking and, to outsiders, it might look like nothing is happening (you just can't see all the *vibes* being communicated amongst them).

                    Pisces is a very romantic sign. They love to be in love, and will devote themselves to their partner like no other sign (except, maybe, Cancer... but Cancer expects that shit in return, with bonuses, whereas Pisces is just happy to be there).</p>
