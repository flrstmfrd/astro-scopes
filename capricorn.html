        <p>Capricorns are born between December 22nd and January 20th, and belong to the Earth element of the zodiac (along with Taurus and Virgo - who they happen to be incredibly compatible with, romantically). The Earth sign crew are all practical, self reliant, stoic and ambitious. You'd want them in your corner... but maybe not at a party.

            Capricorns are ruled by the planet Saturn aka, the "task master", as are Aquarians (or they were until people decided it was actually Uranus, so, looks like Capricorns are on their own. AGAIN).
            
            To get an idea of the classic Capricorn personality traits and types, we need only to look to some of the most famous celeb Capricorns: Kate Middleton, Michelle Obama, Dolly Parton, Bradley Cooper, Zayn Malik and Liam Hemsworth, to name a few.</p>
            
            <h2>Who are you most compatible with?</h2>
                
                <p> The Earth sign crew (Capricorn, Taurus, Virgo) all get on well with each other. 
                    They're on each other's wavelength and share similar priorities and values - to a degree, anyway. 
                    There's a pragmatic, materialistic, hard-headedness to them. 
                    They have no interest in the ethereal or imaginative realm, it's all money/appetite/status/reward, thank you very much. 
                    This Earthy vibe works romantically, professionally and on a friendship level. It's one big, weird love-in. 
                    They can all judge, pressurise and critique each other to the ends of the earth. 
                    And the other signs just have to leave them to it, because it's just something the Earth crew do!</p>
