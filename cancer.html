        <p>Cancerians are born between June 21 and July 22, and belong to the Water element of the zodiac (along with Pisces and Scorpio). Water signs are emotional and intense, they are also extremely intuitive and compassionate. They ‘get’ people.

            Cancers are known for their traits like loyalty, their emotional depth, and their parenting instincts. In your squad they’ll be the one that knows the secrets (and keeps them), the one that others turn to first, and the one that can almost smell when something is off. They are wonderful people to have in your life (although getting them OUT of it, should you want to, is another matter…)
            
            Cancer is ruled by the moon and this connection is strong, it has a direct impact on their moods, which wax and wane as swiftly and powerfully as our planet’s satellite.
            
            To get an idea of the classic Cancerian personality traits and types, we need only to look to some of the most famous crabs (the sign’s symbol): Princess Diana, Ariana Grande, Selena Gomez, Solange Knowles, Nicole Scherzinger, and Lindsay Lohan. You could say all of these people wear their heart on their sleeve.</p>
            
            <h2>Who are you most compatible with?</h2>
                
                <p> Cancerians typically have a string of admirers because they’re usually physically beguiling, funny and intelligent, love sex, and indulge in flirting like it’s going out of fashion. Online dating was a setback for the Cancerian sign - their greatest strength is ‘pulling’ socially, but hey, times change.

                    The Water sign brigade are all in tune with each other and can handle each other’s deep personalities and pathological need for intense relationships- so Pisces, Cancer and Scorpio are good friends, and lovers.</p>
