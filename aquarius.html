        <p>Despite the “aqua” in its name, Aquarius is actually the last air sign of the zodiac. Aquarius is represented by the water bearer, the mystical healer who bestows water, or life, upon the land. 
            Accordingly, Aquarius is the most humanitarian astrological sign. These revolutionary thinkers fervently support “power to the people,” aspiring to change the world through radical social progress. 
            Every Aquarian is a rebel at heart: These air signs despise authority and anything that represents conventionality. 
            Free-spirited and eccentric, they can often be identified by their offbeat fashion sensibilities, unusual hobbies, and nonconformist attitude.</p>
           
                <h2>Who are you most compatible with?</h2>
                <p> The most compatible signs with Aquarius are generally considered to be Aries, Gemini, Libra and Sagittarius. The least compatible signs with Aquarius are generally considered to be Taurus and Scorpio.

                    Comparing sun signs can give a good general idea of compatibility. However, this is just a quick and easy way to compare, and it's going to have lots of exceptions on this broad level.
                    
                    That's because people are more than just their sun sign. There are other planets which also affect someone's personality. This creates billions of permutations making each Aquarius slightly different. Generalizing too far based just on sun signs can therefore be misleading.</p>
