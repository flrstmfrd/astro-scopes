        <p>Geminis are born between May 22 and June 22, and belong to the Air element of the zodiac (along with Libra and Aquarius). Air signs are smart, sharp and speedy; they THINK more than they feel, or do.

            Geminis are the liveliest of the Air sign gang - versatile, youthful, curious and fun. They make great company, but they are hard to pin down in any way, so they’re notoriously easier to connect with as friends than partners.
            
            Gemini is ruled by the planet Mercury, which makes them fast, witty and super into communications. Words are their weapon of choice.
            
            To get an idea of the classic Gemini personality traits and types, we need only to look to some of the most famous twins (the star sign’s symbol): Kanye West, Kylie Minogue, Tupac, Marilyn Monroe, Angelina Jolie, Donald Trump (sorry), and Johnny Depp (sorry again) to name a few. These guys ALL have big personalities.</p>
            
            <h2>Who are you most compatible with?</h2>
                
                <p> Many people fleetingly fancy the Gemmys because of their youthful, fun, partying exterior… but not THAT many can get past their actual chilly nature and need to be free and untethered. Relationships are sometimes difficult for them. Just one person for forever and forever? Mmm…

                    Other Air signs respect that need for space, though, because they feel it too, and are entertaining and clever enough to keep things stimulating. So, Libra, Gemini and Aquarius ALL get on well.</p>
