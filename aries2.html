        <p>Aries folk are born between March 21st and April 20th, and belong to the Fire element of the zodiac (along with Sagittarius and Leo). The Fire sign brigade are the *hooligans* of the stars - bold, brash, passionate, outspoken and likely to act before they think.

            Aries is not only the first sign of the zodiac (i.e. the baby) but is also ruled by the planet Mars, which represents war, aggression and conflict. Let me give you a clue about Aries... Don't ever get in a competition with them. They can transform a light game of tiddly winks into a Battle Royale, and would rather keel over and die than yield. They can be, ahem, intense.
            
            To get an idea of the classic Aries personality traits and types, we need only to look to some of the most famous rams (the sign’s spirit animal): Lady Gaga, Sarah Jessica Parker, Mariah Carey and Chance the Rapper to name a few.</p>
           
                <h2>Who are you most compatible with?</h2>
                <p> Kind of everyone, because they’re so friendly and open. However, like all elemental groups, the Fire sign trio (Aries, Sagittarius and Leo) all get on well with each other. They're all bright, bubbly, outgoing and action-orientated. It’s like a sexy, high octane Tough Mudder event, with spangles and glitter balls. It’s loud and brash.</p>
