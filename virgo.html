        <p>Virgos are always paying attention to the smallest details and their deep sense of humanity makes them one of the most careful signs of the zodiac. Their methodical approach to life ensures that nothing is left to chance, and although they are often tender, their heart might be closed for the outer world. This is a sign often misunderstood, not because they lack the ability to express, but because they won’t accept their feelings as valid, true, or even relevant when opposed to reason. The symbolism behind the name speaks well of their nature, born with a feeling they are experiencing everything for the first time.


            Virgo is an Earth sign, fitting perfectly between Taurus and Capricorn. This will lead to a strong character, but one that prefers conservative, well-organized things and a lot of practicality in their everyday life. These individuals have an organized life, and even when they let go to chaos, their goals and dreams still have strictly defined borders in their mind. Constantly worried that they missed a detail that will be impossible to fix, they can get stuck in details, becoming overly critical and concerned about matters that nobody else seems to care much about.
            
            </p>
           
                <h2>Who are you most compatible with?</h2>
                <p> The sign of Virgo leads Venus to its tragic fall and speaks of one’s inability to feel worthy, beautiful, or lovable. Compatibility of Virgo with other zodiac signs is mostly based on the ability of their partner to give them all the love they need to start feeling safe and open up enough to show their soft, vulnerable heart. They will rarely have direct statements of love, but intimacy brings out all of the beauty of their emotional self-expression. A Virgo will prefer a stable relationship than having fun, casual lovers, except if they become one, using their charm and superficial communication to win hearts without ever investing their own. </p>
