        <p>Leos are born between July 23 and August 22, and belong to the Fire element of the zodiac (along with Aries and Sagittarius). Fire signs are big, bouncy show-offs with equally big ideas and even bigger hearts.

            Lovable Leos are famously known for their exuberance, loyalty and self-confidence. Whether it’s around their pals, gym, home, office or club, they treat their environment like their own personal kingdom. They are Queen, obvs, and everyone else is, well, ‘subjects’ (albeit they’re fiercely protective and loving towards those they have under their ‘rule’… just don't forget who’s boss).
            
            Leo is ruled by the sun and this makes them optimistic, enthusiastic, passionate and spontaneous. Their presence can, literally, ‘light up’ a room.
            
            To get an idea of the classic Leo personality traits and types, we need only to look to some of the most famous lions (the sign’s symbol): Madonna, Jennifer Lopez, Kylie Jenner, Sandra Bullock.</h2>
               
            <h2>Who are you most compatible with?</h2>

                <p> Leos are big time flirts and tend to their (loonnnng) list of admirers with the same effort and attention as many of us would put into, like, a job. The Leo flirt prides themselves on being able to crack ANY nut- in fact the tougher the crowd, the more obsessed they are (so, play ultra hard-to-get if you want to have a Leo chasing after you).

                    The Fire sign posse love to go on adventures, raise each other’s game, have fun, be spontaneous and take risks- so Leo, Aries and Sagittarius make for lively friendships and passionate relationships.</p>
